# Hockey Game Prediction
This repository includes code for feature engineering, feature selection, and statistical modeling for hockey game prediction. Multiple classifiers ranging from logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest trees were trained to predict whether a shot could become a goal.

Sample code to run all modules is included in ***notebooks/Compare_models.ipynb***.
